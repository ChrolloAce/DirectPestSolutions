                Miami's year-round heat and humidity create the perfect breeding ground for pests. From mosquitoes and 
                ants to termites and roaches, South Florida's tropical climate attracts unwanted visitors to your property. 
                Here are essential prevention tips to keep pests away during Miami's hottest months.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">Why Miami's Heat Attracts Pests</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Unlike other climates where pests hibernate or die off in winter, Miami's consistently warm temperatures 
                mean pests are active year-round. The combination of high humidity, frequent rain, and tropical heat creates 
                ideal conditions for pest reproduction and activity. Understanding this helps you stay vigilant with prevention.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">Top 10 Pest Prevention Tips for Miami Heat</h2>
              
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">1. Eliminate Standing Water</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Mosquitoes can breed in as little as a bottle cap of water. Check your property weekly for standing water 
                in plant saucers, gutters, bird baths, and outdoor containers. Change water features regularly and ensure 
                proper drainage around your foundation.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">2. Seal Entry Points</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Inspect your home's exterior for cracks, gaps, and holes. Seal openings around windows, doors, pipes, and 
                utility lines. Use weather stripping on doors and windows. Even small gaps can allow ants, roaches, and 
                rodents to enter your home.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">3. Maintain Your Yard</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Keep grass trimmed, bushes pruned, and vegetation away from your home's foundation. Overgrown landscaping 
                provides shelter for mosquitoes, ants, rodents, and other pests. Remove yard debris, fallen fruit, and 
                organic matter that attracts pests.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">4. Store Food Properly</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Keep all food in sealed containers, including pet food. Clean up crumbs and spills immediately. Don't leave 
                dirty dishes overnight. Take garbage out regularly and use bins with tight-fitting lids. These simple steps 
                eliminate food sources that attract roaches, ants, and rodents.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">5. Fix Leaks and Reduce Moisture</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Repair leaky pipes, faucets, and AC units. Use dehumidifiers in damp areas. Ensure proper ventilation in 
                bathrooms and kitchens. Pests like roaches, termites, and silverfish are attracted to moisture and can 
                cause significant damage if left unchecked.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">6. Screen Windows and Doors</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Install or repair window and door screens to keep flying insects out while enjoying fresh air. Check screens 
                regularly for tears or gaps and repair immediately. Consider screen enclosures for patios and pools.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">7. Clean Gutters Regularly</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Clogged gutters collect water and organic debris, creating perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes and 
                shelter for other pests. Clean gutters at least quarterly, more often during rainy season.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">8. Store Firewood Properly</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                If you store firewood, keep it at least 20 feet from your home and elevated off the ground. Firewood piles 
                attract termites, ants, and other wood-destroying insects that can migrate to your house.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">9. Use Outdoor Lighting Wisely</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Replace white outdoor lights with yellow or sodium vapor lights that are less attractive to insects. Keep 
                lights away from doors and windows. Consider motion-sensor lights to reduce the time lights are on.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">10. Schedule Regular Inspections</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Professional pest inspections can identify problems before they become infestations. Our licensed 
                exterminators know where to look for early signs of pest activity and can treat issues before they escalate.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">Miami-Specific Pest Challenges</h2>
              
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">Hurricane Season Preparation</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Before hurricane season, inspect and repair your home's exterior. After storms, remove standing water 
                immediately and check for new entry points created by wind damage. Storms can displace pests and drive 
                them into homes seeking shelter.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">Rainy Season Protection</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Miami's rainy season (May-October) brings increased mosquito and ant activity. Be extra vigilant about 
                standing water removal during this time. Consider professional mosquito treatments for outdoor areas.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">Year-Round Termite Risk</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Miami's warm, humid climate means termites are active year-round. Annual termite inspections are essential. 
                Watch for mud tubes, hollow-sounding wood, discarded wings, and wood damage.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">When to Call Professionals</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                While prevention is important, some situations require professional intervention:
