              <p className="text-xl text-brand-black/80 mb-8 font-medium leading-relaxed">
                Pest problems rarely appear overnight. Most infestations give warning signs long before becoming severe. 
                Learning to recognize these early indicators can save you thousands in damage repair and eliminate health 
                risks before they escalate. Here are 10 warning signs that it's time to call professional pest control.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">1. You See Live Pests</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                The most obvious sign—actually seeing pests—often indicates a larger hidden population. Most pests avoid 
                detection, so visible activity suggests significant numbers are present. Seeing roaches during the day, 
                multiple rodents, or ant trails means you have an active infestation requiring professional treatment. 
                Don't assume you've only seen "a few"—for every pest you see, many more are hiding.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">2. Droppings and Feces</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Pest droppings are telltale signs of infestation:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-brand-black/80 mb-6 space-y-2 ml-4 leading-relaxed">
                <li><strong>Rodent droppings</strong> - Small, dark pellets near food sources, along baseboards, or in cabinets</li>
                <li><strong>Roach feces</strong> - Look like black pepper or coffee grounds, often in corners and cracks</li>
                <li><strong>Termite frass</strong> - Small piles of wood-colored pellets near wooden structures</li>
                <li><strong>Bed bug spots</strong> - Tiny dark spots on bedding and mattresses</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Finding droppings means pests have established a presence. The quantity and freshness of droppings indicate 
                infestation severity. Professional identification ensures proper treatment for the specific pest.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">3. Strange Odors</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Many pests produce distinctive smells. A musty, oily odor often indicates roaches. Rodent urine creates 
                an ammonia smell. Bed bugs produce a sweet, musty scent. If you notice unusual odors, especially in 
                enclosed spaces like closets or attics, investigate further. Strong or worsening odors suggest large pest 
                populations or dead pests in walls.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">4. Property Damage</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Pests cause various types of damage:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-brand-black/80 mb-6 space-y-2 ml-4 leading-relaxed">
                <li><strong>Chew marks</strong> on food packaging, cardboard, wires, or wood</li>
                <li><strong>Holes in walls or floors</strong> where rodents have gnawed through</li>
                <li><strong>Damaged fabrics</strong> from clothes moths or carpet beetles</li>
                <li><strong>Wood damage</strong> from termites or carpenter ants</li>
                <li><strong>Scratched or torn insulation</strong> from rodent nesting</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Property damage indicates established pest activity. Some damage, particularly termite damage, threatens 
                structural integrity if not addressed quickly. Professional pest control stops damage progression and 
                prevents costly repairs.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">5. Nests or Hives</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Finding nests confirms pest presence. Rodent nests made from shredded paper, fabric, and insulation appear 
                in hidden areas like attics, garages, and wall voids. Wasp or bee nests around your property pose stinging 
                risks. Ant nests may be visible as dirt mounds in yards. Never attempt to remove nests yourself—professional 
                removal ensures complete elimination and prevents dangerous encounters.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">6. Strange Sounds</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Hearing scratching, scurrying, or squeaking in walls, ceilings, or attics indicates rodent activity. These 
                sounds are most noticeable at night when rodents are most active. Buzzing sounds may indicate stinging 
                insects. Don't ignore unusual sounds—they confirm pests are using your home's hidden spaces and likely 
                reproducing.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">7. Grease Marks and Track Trails</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Rodents and roaches leave greasy smudge marks along walls, pipes, and baseboards where they travel 
                repeatedly. These marks result from body oils and dirt transferring to surfaces. You might also notice 
                dust-free paths in dusty areas, footprint tracks in flour or powder, or tail drag marks. These trails 
                reveal regular pest pathways and help professionals determine infestation extent.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">8. Unusual Pet Behavior</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Pets often detect pests before humans do. If your dog or cat suddenly pays unusual attention to walls, 
                baseboards, or specific areas, they may be sensing pests. Increased scratching can indicate fleas. Pawing 
                at walls or staring at particular spots suggests rodents or insects inside. Don't dismiss your pet's 
                behavior—investigate areas of interest.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">9. Plants or Gardens Being Damaged</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Outdoor pest activity often precedes indoor infestations. Chewed leaves, missing fruits or vegetables, 
                holes in lawns, or destroyed plant roots indicate pest presence. Aphids, caterpillars, and grubs damage 
                plants. Rodents and wildlife eat garden produce. Addressing outdoor pest problems prevents them from moving 
                indoors seeking food and shelter.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">10. Previous Pest Problems</h2>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                If you've had pest issues before, you're at higher risk for recurrence—especially without professional 
                prevention. One-time treatments rarely address underlying conditions attracting pests. If you've dealt 
                with pests in the past, ongoing professional pest control provides continuous monitoring and prevention, 
                stopping reinfestations before they start.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">Miami-Specific Pest Warning Signs</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">Termite Swarmers</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Seeing flying termites (swarmers) or finding discarded wings near windows and doors is a critical warning 
                sign. Miami's warm climate means termites swarm year-round. Swarmers indicate an established colony nearby, 
                possibly in your home. Immediate professional inspection is essential.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">Increased Mosquito Activity</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                While mosquitoes are common in Miami, sudden increases in populations around your property suggest nearby 
                breeding sites. Check for standing water in plant saucers, clogged gutters, or yard debris. Professional 
                mosquito treatment reduces populations and identifies breeding sources.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-6 mb-3">Ant Trails Indoors</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Miami's most common ant species (Argentine ants, ghost ants) often invade during rainy season. If you see 
                ant trails indoors, the colony has found food and water sources in your home. Professional treatment 
                eliminates colonies at the source rather than just killing visible ants.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-4">When to Call Professional Pest Control</h2>

              <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-6 mb-8">

              <p className="text-brand-black/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">

                and prevention.
